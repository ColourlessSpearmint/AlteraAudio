# AlteraAudio
AlteraAudio is a program written in the Python programming language designed to download YouTube videos and audio. It simplifies the download process, eliminating the need for complex setups or external tools. In addition to offering a user-friendly interface with non-programmer users in mind, AlteraAudio also has a key advantage over other downloaders: the ability to preserve metadata. If the user elects to download a song, this functionality ensures that downloaded audio files retain crucial information such as artist name, song title, and album name. 

AlteraAudio is designed to be used in Google Colab, although it should work in other environments.
